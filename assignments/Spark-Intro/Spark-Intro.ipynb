    "\n",

Next is a vertical bar (``|``) followed by a unique identifier for the contig within the organism. There may then be additional text describing the contig. Finally, there will be a ``<`` symbol. After this symbol, the remaining text on the line contains the DNA code. As you may know, this text consists of the characters A, C, T, and G.\n",
